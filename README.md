# Todo

- [ ] Improve prompt for better usability
  - There is still a lot of room for optimization. One issue is the
    context limitation, for example, GPT3.5 can only handle 4k tokens
    and will explode if a file is submitted casually; currently, it is
    simply truncated roughly according to proportions. Another approach
    is similar to [gptcommit](https://github.com/zurawiki/gptcommit),
    summarizing each file once with diff and then integrating all the
    summaries to generate a commit. However, this method requires n + 2
    requests to generate one message.
- [ ] LRU Cache or Disk Cache
- [ ] NO Stream
- [ ] Other LLM Support
